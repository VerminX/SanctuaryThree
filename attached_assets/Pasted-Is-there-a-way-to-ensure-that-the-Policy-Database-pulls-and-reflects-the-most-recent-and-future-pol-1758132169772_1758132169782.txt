Is there a way to ensure that the Policy Database pulls, and reflects the most recent and future policies.

I'm most concerned with the RAG features sending the MOST up to date and future coverage policies to the AI for it's generation and assessment.
How can we ensure that the policies which are the most relevant and most up to date are the ones which it generates based off of and analyzes against at all times.

Decided on policy freshness strategy (5 seconds)
Excellent question! Policy freshness is critical for accurate pre-determination analysis. Let me analyze your current system and provide recommendations for ensuring your RAG features always use the most current and relevant policies.

Current Policy Management Analysis
Let me first examine your existing policy update system:


Decided on policy system improvements
Analysis: Current Policy Management vs. Optimal Freshness
Based on your codebase analysis, here's how your system currently handles policy freshness and what improvements are needed:

Current State Analysis
✅ What's Working Well:

Nightly Updates: Scheduled policy refresh at 2:00 AM daily
Real CMS Integration: Successfully pulling from live CMS Coverage API
MAC Region Filtering: RAG correctly filters by tenant's MAC region
Effective Date Sorting: Policies sorted by most recent effective date first
⚠️ Critical Gaps Identified:

Future Policy Handling: Your system only fetches "final" LCDs but ignores "proposed" LCDs with future effective dates
Policy Versioning: No handling of policy updates/supersessions
Effective Date Logic: RAG doesn't distinguish between current vs. future effective policies
Content Limitations: Using placeholder content instead of full LCD text
Cache Invalidation: No mechanism to invalidate RAG context when policies change
Recommendations for Optimal Policy Freshness
1. Enhanced Policy Data Collection
Add Proposed Policies Integration:

// Your CMS API already has this endpoint!
proposedLCDsEndpoint: "/v1/reports/local-coverage-proposed-lcds"
Benefits:

Capture policies with future effective dates (announcements, policy changes)
Pre-populate upcoming coverage changes for proactive analysis
Allow AI to reference "upcoming changes" in determinations
2. Intelligent Policy Status Management
Current Issue: All policies marked as 'active' regardless of effective date

Recommendation: Implement time-aware policy status:

current: Effective now and not superseded
future: Effective date in future
superseded: Replaced by newer version
proposed: In comment period, not yet final
3. Enhanced RAG Context Selection
Current Logic: Takes top 5 policies by effective date
Improved Logic: Prioritize by:

Current active policies (effective now)
Future policies (within 90 days) with clear annotations
Most recent version if multiple versions exist
Wound type relevance scoring
4. Real-Time Policy Monitoring
Beyond Nightly Updates:

Incremental Updates: Check for policy changes every 4 hours during business days
Event-Driven Updates: Monitor CMS RSS feeds or change notifications
Delta Processing: Only update changed policies, not full refresh
5. Content Enhancement Strategy
Current Issue: Placeholder content limits AI analysis accuracy

Solution Phases:

Phase 1: Enhance existing list-based approach with better metadata extraction
Phase 2: Implement selective full-text retrieval for most-used policies
Phase 3: Web scraping fallback for complete policy text from MAC websites
6. RAG Context Optimization
Policy Selection Algorithm:

// Proposed enhancement to buildRAGContext
const policyPriority = (policy: PolicySource, currentDate: Date) => {
  const daysFromEffective = Math.abs(currentDate.getTime() - policy.effectiveDate.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  
  // Current policies get highest priority
  if (policy.status === 'current') return 1000 - daysFromEffective;
  
  // Future policies (within 90 days) get medium priority  
  if (policy.status === 'future' && daysFromEffective <= 90) return 500 - daysFromEffective;
  
  // Proposed policies get lower priority but still included
  if (policy.status === 'proposed') return 100 - daysFromEffective;
  
  return 0;
};
7. Change Detection & Notifications
Policy Change Tracking:

Version Management: Track when policies are updated/superseded
Change Notifications: Alert users when policies affecting their patients change
Impact Analysis: Identify which active cases might be affected by policy changes
Implementation Priority
Phase 1 (Immediate - High Impact)
Fix Policy Content: Replace placeholder content with actual policy excerpts
Add Future Policy Support: Include proposed LCDs in sync process
Enhance RAG Selection: Implement priority-based policy selection
Phase 2 (Near-term - Quality Improvements)
Policy Versioning: Track and handle policy updates properly
Incremental Updates: Reduce update frequency to 4-hour intervals
Content Enhancement: Selective full-text retrieval for key policies
Phase 3 (Long-term - Advanced Features)
Real-time Monitoring: Event-driven policy change detection
Impact Analysis: Automated alerts for policy changes affecting active cases
Predictive Analysis: AI analysis of proposed policy impacts
Immediate Action Items
Would you like me to implement any of these improvements? I'd recommend starting with:

Proposed Policy Integration - Add future policies to your database
Enhanced RAG Logic - Improve policy selection for AI analysis
Content Enhancement - Extract better policy summaries from CMS data
These changes would immediately improve the relevance and currency of your AI-powered pre-determination analysis.
