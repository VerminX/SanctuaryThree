Based on my analysis of your current application and the PDF samples you've attached, here's what it would take to add an "Upload" page for automatic patient and encounter creation from PDFs:

Current Application Strengths
Your application already has:

Well-structured patient and encounter data models with encryption
OpenAI integration for AI processing
Document generation capabilities (PDF/DOCX output)
Robust authentication and multi-tenant architecture
Form validation with Zod schemas
What You'd Need to Add
1. File Upload Infrastructure
Object Storage: Add Replit's object storage integration for secure PDF storage
Upload UI: Create a drag-and-drop interface for PDF uploads
File Validation: PDF format checking, size limits, and basic security scanning
2. PDF Processing Capabilities
You'd need new libraries for:

PDF Text Extraction: Libraries like pdf-parse or pdf2pic + OCR for scanned documents
OCR Support: For documents that are image-based rather than text-based
Document Classification: AI to identify document types (registration forms vs. medical records)
3. AI-Powered Data Extraction
Building on your existing OpenAI integration:

Structured Parsing: Use GPT to extract patient demographics, insurance info, medical history
Form Field Mapping: Map extracted data to your existing patient/encounter schemas
Data Validation: Ensure extracted data meets your database requirements
4. New Backend Routes
POST /api/upload/pdf - Handle file uploads
POST /api/extract/patient-data - Process PDF and extract patient information
POST /api/create-from-pdf - Create patient and encounter records from extracted data
5. Frontend Components
Upload Page: New page at /upload with file upload interface
Preview Component: Show extracted data before creating records
Conflict Resolution: Handle duplicate patients or data conflicts
Progress Tracking: Real-time feedback during processing
Technical Approach
Looking at your PDF samples, I can see:

Registration Form: Contains patient demographics, insurance, emergency contacts
Medical Records: Contains encounter details, medications, procedures, diagnoses
The system would:

Upload & Store: Securely store PDFs in object storage
Extract Text: Use PDF parsing to get raw text content
AI Analysis: Send text to OpenAI to extract structured data
Data Mapping: Map extracted fields to your existing schemas
Create Records: Automatically populate patient and encounter tables
Review Interface: Let users verify/edit before final creation
Estimated Scope
This would be a medium-to-large feature requiring:

3-4 new backend routes
2-3 new frontend pages/components
PDF processing library integration
Object storage setup
AI prompt engineering for data extraction
Comprehensive error handling
Would you like me to start implementing this upload functionality? I can begin with the file upload infrastructure and basic PDF text extraction, then build up to the AI-powered data extraction.
