Based on my comprehensive analysis of the codebase, I can see this is a substantial enhancement that will significantly improve the clinical workflow. Let me break down the current architecture and provide a detailed implementation plan.

üîç Current Architecture Analysis
Current Data Model:
Patients ‚Üí Encounters (1:many relationship)
Documents & EligibilityChecks ‚Üí Individual Encounters
FileUploads ‚Üí PdfExtractedData (extraction results stored separately)
No "episode" concept - each encounter is independent
Current PDF Workflow:
PDF Upload ‚Üí Text Extraction ‚Üí AI Data Extraction ‚Üí Manual Record Creation
Each encounter analyzed in isolation
Documents/eligibility tied to single encounters only
üéØ Enhanced Architecture Plan
Phase 1: Data Model Enhancement
New episodes Table:

// Episodes - Group related encounters for the same wound/condition
export const episodes = pgTable("episodes", {
  id: uuid("id").primaryKey().default(sql`gen_random_uuid()`),
  patientId: uuid("patient_id").notNull().references(() => patients.id),
  woundType: varchar("wound_type", { length: 100 }).notNull(), // DFU, VLU, etc.
  woundLocation: varchar("wound_location", { length: 100 }).notNull(),
  episodeStartDate: timestamp("episode_start_date").notNull(),
  episodeEndDate: timestamp("episode_end_date"), // Null if ongoing
  status: varchar("status", { length: 20 }).default("active"), // active, resolved, chronic
  primaryDiagnosis: varchar("primary_diagnosis", { length: 255 }),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at").defaultNow(),
});
Updated encounters Table:

// Add episodeId to existing encounters
episodeId: uuid("episode_id").references(() => episodes.id),
Enhanced eligibilityChecks:

// Update to reference episodes instead of individual encounters
episodeId: uuid("episode_id").notNull().references(() => episodes.id),
encounterId: uuid("encounter_id").references(() => encounters.id), // Optional specific encounter
Enhanced documents:

// Add episode-level document generation
episodeId: uuid("episode_id").references(() => episodes.id),
Phase 2: Enhanced PDF Upload Workflow
Automatic Patient/Episode/Encounter Creation:

// New workflow in create-records endpoint:
1. Extract patient data ‚Üí Create/find patient by MRN
2. Extract wound details ‚Üí Create/find episode by wound type/location
3. Extract encounter data ‚Üí Create new encounter within episode
4. Link PDF to patient/episode/encounter via pdfExtractedData
5. Auto-trigger eligibility analysis using FULL episode context
PDF Attachment System:

// Enhanced pdfExtractedData linking
export const pdfExtractedData = pgTable("pdf_extracted_data", {
  // ... existing fields ...
  episodeId: uuid("episode_id").references(() => episodes.id), // New field
  isAttachedToChart: boolean("is_attached_to_chart").default(true), // New field
});
Phase 3: Holistic Analysis Enhancement
Episode-Aware Eligibility Analysis:

// Modified analyzeEligibility to use full episode context
export async function analyzeEpisodeEligibility(request: {
  episodeId: string,
  patientInfo: PatientInfo,
  policyContext: string
}): Promise<EligibilityAnalysisResponse> {
  // 1. Gather ALL encounters in the episode
  // 2. Aggregate wound progression, conservative care history
  // 3. Build comprehensive clinical narrative
  // 4. Analyze against policies with full context
}
Enhanced Document Generation:

// Episode-level document generation
export async function generateEpisodeDocument(request: {
  episodeId: string,
  type: 'PreDetermination' | 'LMN',
  includeAllEncounters: boolean
}): Promise<GeneratedDocument> {
  // Use complete episode history for more accurate letters
}
üìã Implementation Steps
Step 1: Database Schema Updates ‚≠ê
// Add episodes table and update relationships
// Run: npm run db:push --force
Step 2: Storage Layer Updates ‚≠ê
// Add episode CRUD operations to storage.ts
// Update existing patient/encounter operations
// Add episode-aware query methods
Step 3: Enhanced PDF Processing ‚≠ê
// Modify create-records endpoint:
// - Auto-create episode logic
// - Enhanced encounter creation within episodes
// - PDF attachment to chart records
Step 4: Episode-Aware AI Analysis
// Update eligibility analysis to consider full episode
// Aggregate multiple encounters for comprehensive assessment
// Enhanced citation and rationale based on episode progression
Step 5: Enhanced Document Generation
// Update document templates for episode-level information
// Include wound progression timeline
// Comprehensive conservative care history
Step 6: Frontend Updates
// Update patient charts to show episodes
// Episode timeline view with attached documents
// Enhanced upload workflow with automatic record creation
üöÄ Benefits of This Architecture
Clinical Benefits:
Holistic Patient View: Episodes group related encounters for better clinical context
Comprehensive Analysis: AI considers full wound care history, not just single visits
Better Documentation: Generated letters include complete episode narrative
Streamlined Workflow: Automatic patient/encounter creation from PDF uploads
Technical Benefits:
HIPAA Compliant: Maintains existing encryption and security patterns
Scalable: Episodes can accommodate complex, multi-visit wound care scenarios
Backward Compatible: Existing encounters can be migrated to episodes
Flexible: Supports both single-encounter and multi-encounter episodes
‚úÖ Feasibility Assessment
This enhancement is absolutely feasible with the current codebase because:

Solid Foundation: Existing patient/encounter/document architecture is well-designed
Encryption Patterns: PHI encryption is already implemented and can be extended
AI Integration: OpenAI/Azure OpenAI integration is already working
Object Storage: PDF attachment system is already functional
Database Schema: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM makes schema changes straightforward
üéØ Recommended Implementation Priority
Phase 1 (Core): Database schema + basic episode functionality
Phase 2 (Essential): Enhanced PDF workflow with auto-record creation
Phase 3 (Advanced): Episode-aware analysis and document generation
Phase 4 (Polish): Frontend episode timeline and enhanced UI
Would you like me to proceed with implementing any specific phase, or would you prefer to see the detailed code changes for the database schema first?
