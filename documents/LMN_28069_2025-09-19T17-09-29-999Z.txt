To Whom It May Concern,

Re: Letter of Medical Necessity for Michael Hudson  
Date of Birth: February 27, 1948  

I am writing to provide a Letter of Medical Necessity for Mr. Michael Hudson, who has been under my care for a full-thickness diabetic ulcer located on the plantar surface of the right hallux. This letter outlines the medical necessity for the use of a non-analogous skin substitute/Cellular Tissue Product (CTP) based on the patient's clinical history, treatment compliance, and documented wound progression.

**Medical Necessity Narrative:**

Mr. Hudson presents with a full-thickness diabetic ulcer that has exposed the fat layer. The comprehensive analysis of his patient history indicates that he has been compliant with conservative care protocols, including regular dressing changes and offloading measures, which are critical in managing diabetic ulcers. 

Over the course of treatment, wound measurements have shown a significant decrease in size, from 2cm × 1.7cm to 1.2cm × 1.1cm. This reduction demonstrates a positive trend in healing, which is essential for justifying the need for advanced wound care interventions. 

Recent evaluations have noted maceration of the wound, indicating a need for more advanced treatment options to facilitate healing and prevent complications. Given Mr. Hudson's readiness for skin grafting, it is imperative to utilize a skin substitute/CTP to enhance the healing process and improve outcomes.

**Conservative Care Documentation:**

- **March 27, 2025:** Wound measuring 2cm × 1.7cm; patient compliant with dressing change protocol; stable with no signs of infection.
- **April 3, 2025:** Wound measuring 1.6cm × 1.5cm; patient compliant with dressing change protocol; stable with no signs of infection.
- **April 10, 2025:** Wound measuring 1.3cm × 1.2cm; patient compliant with dressing change protocol; stable with no signs of infection.
- **April 17, 2025:** Wound measuring 1.2cm × 1.1cm; noted maceration; partial compliance due to personal circumstances; improved from previous visit.

**Citations and References:**

This letter aligns with the Local Coverage Determination (LCD) criteria for advanced wound care, which emphasizes the necessity of using advanced modalities when conservative measures have been implemented without achieving adequate healing. The patient's history of compliance and the documented progression of the wound support the medical necessity for the requested treatment.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend the approval of the non-analogous skin substitute/CTP for Mr. Hudson to facilitate optimal healing of his diabetic ulcer. Should you require any further information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact my office.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
