Dear [Insurance Representative's Name],

We are writing to request a pre-determination for the use of a non-analogous skin substitute/CTP for our patient, Brittany Hunt, who has been under our care for a diabetic foot ulcer located at the right great toe. This letter outlines the medical necessity of the requested treatment based on the patient's comprehensive history and compliance with conservative care measures.

**Medical Necessity Narrative:**

Ms. Hunt presented with a Wagner grade 2 diabetic foot ulcer, which has shown significant improvement and has completely healed within a 12-week period. Our analysis indicates that the patient has demonstrated excellent compliance with conservative care measures throughout the treatment episode. The wound healing trajectory aligns with the Local Coverage Determination (LCD) criteria for the use of skin substitutes.

**Conservative Care Documentation:**

The following outlines the key encounters and findings throughout Ms. Hunt's treatment:

1. **Initial Encounter (01/15/2024)**  
   - Wound size: 2.0cm x 1.8cm, depth 4mm, moderate drainage  
   - No active infection noted  
   - Care Compliance: Excellent compliance with daily dressing changes and offloading.  
   - Wound Progression: Stable, initial assessment.

2. **Follow-up Encounter (01/29/2024)**  
   - Wound size reduced to 1.5cm x 1.4cm, depth 3mm, minimal drainage  
   - No infection noted  
   - Care Compliance: Continued excellent compliance.  
   - Wound Progression: Improved, showing signs of healing.

3. **Follow-up Encounter (02/26/2024)**  
   - Wound size further reduced to 1.0cm x 0.9cm, depth 1mm, minimal drainage  
   - No infection noted  
   - Care Compliance: Excellent compliance maintained.  
   - Wound Progression: Improved, healthy pink granulation tissue observed.

4. **Final Follow-up Encounter (04/10/2024)**  
   - Wound completely healed, no drainage  
   - No infection noted  
   - Care Compliance: Excellent compliance throughout the treatment period.  
   - Wound Progression: Healed, fully epithelialized.

**Eligibility Analysis:**

Based on our comprehensive review, Ms. Hunt meets the eligibility criteria for the requested treatment. Key points include:
- Successful healing of the diabetic foot ulcer from Wagner grade 2 to complete epithelialization within the prescribed timeframe.
- Consistent compliance with conservative care measures, including daily dressing changes and offloading.
- No recurrent infections or complications noted throughout the treatment episodes.

**Citations and References:**

The rationale for this pre-determination request is supported by the following:
- Local Coverage Determination (LCD) guidelines for skin substitutes.
- Clinical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of conservative care in managing diabetic foot ulcers.

We appreciate your consideration of this pre-determination request and look forward to your prompt response. Should you require any additional information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact our office at 615-542-9672.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
